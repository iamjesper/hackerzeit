# Hackerzeit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iamjesper/hackerzeit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iamjesper/hackerzeit)

Hackerzeit is a [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) clone built with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) using the official [HN API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

Not a massive departure from the original design of HN, but tweaked in a way I personally find more readable.

Apart from being a little bored during Corona lockdown, a reason to build this was to try out how tightly [~~Zeit~~ Vercel](https://vercel.com/) integrates as a hosting provider for a Next app.
